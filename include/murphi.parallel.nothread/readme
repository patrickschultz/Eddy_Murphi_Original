Implementation documentation
----------------------------

The implementation including all the main algorithms used has been extensive 
documented. The documentation for the file say mu_system.C is in the 
corresponding .txt file, i.e., mu_system.C.txt. This includes the comments 
from the .C source file as well as the additional comments.

codeorg.txt gives a high level overview of the way the code is organized.

The pseudocode for the heuristics can be obtained from the thesis, and their
implementation can be followed by reading the code in mu_system.C along with 
the corresponding .txt file.

--------

The various command line arguments can be seen by running the (compiled) 
verifier that has been generated, using the -h command line argument. This will
show the args for the various heuristics as well as the other arguments.
