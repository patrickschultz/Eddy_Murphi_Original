===========================================================================

This release is based on the original Murphi Release 3.1 and has been
modified to implement state space caching. Responsible for the 
original Murphi Release 3.1 is Ulrich Stern (uli@verify.stanford.edu).

For more information about this release and the state space caching,

1. Modifications to the distribution files

Directories bin, ex, doc are the same as in Murphi 3.1.
Directories src, include have been modified w.r.t. Murphi 3.1.
See the README.cmurphi files in each of these directories for
more information.


2. Modifications to the Murphi Compiler

The following option has been added to the mu compiler:

 --cache	enables the state caching

When this option is specified, state space caching is enabled
in the generated verifiers. If the option is not specified,
the compiler generates the same verifiers as Murphi 3.1


3. Modifications to the Murphi Verifier

The following options have been added to the verifier:

 -maxc<n>      highest admitted collision rate. Zero for no limit.
               (percent value, default 90).

This option tells the verifier to stop when the collision rate
in the state cache it too high. The collision rate is the ratio
states_overwritten(collisions) / states_written in the state
cache. When this rate is too high, the cache is forgetting too
many visited states and the state exploration may loop indefinitely.
The default value for this option, 90, tells the verifier to stop
when the 90% of the visited states overwrite an already visited state
in the state cache.

 -maxl<n>      maximum reachable bfs level. Zero for no limit.
               (default is no limit).

This option tells the verifier to stop when it begins the
exploration of a particular level in the BFS tree.
This may help to stop explorations that are looping when
height of the search tree is known or can be estimated.

The following options have been disabled:

 -s 
	
 -vdfs

The Cached Murphi state space caching algorithm works only
with Breadth First Search, so the DFS and simulation options
are disabled.


3. Compiling the Cached Murphi Compiler and Verifier

To compile the Cached Murphi Compiler, follow the instructions
in the Readme file in src directory.
